### Description

We have built a news aggregating web application that pulls stories from websites like ABC News, BBC, and Wall Street Journal using APIs. Upon being run the application displays a empty search bar, and a few top articles relating to a popular news topic.The web app allows the user search for stories using keywords and allows seleciton, via checkbox, of all the websites that they would like to search with a specific key word. The applicaiton will return all relevant articles and display them with a title, photo, a link to the article, the source of the article, and the author. We also implemented a login and user account capability that allows users to favorite specific articles as long as they are logged into their account. In doing so the user is able to revisit that article whenever they wish or until it is unfavorited. As just mentioned unfavorited of favorites is also available to remove old article clutter from your personal account favorites.
